📝 Daily DSA & Work Journal
🚀 Introduction
Welcome to my daily coding repository. This project serves as a dedicated work journal where I document my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). My primary focus here is consistency—showing up every day to solve problems and improve my problem-solving logic.

📂 Repository Structure
To keep a clear timeline of my progress, I have organized this repository chronologically. The folders are structured by date, making it easy to track what I learned on any specific day.

The Folder Hierarchy: Year > Month > Date > [Solution Files]

Example Path: /2024/December/01-12-2024/Two_Sum.py

🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Languages: Python, C++, Java (Update based on what you use)

Platforms: LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, HackerRank

Key Topics: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming

🧠 What I Track
For every daily folder, I aim to include:

The Solution: The actual code that passed the test cases.

Approach & Logic: A brief note on how I arrived at the solution.

Complexity Analysis: Time and Space complexity details (e.g., O(n)).

📈 My Goal
The goal is not just to write code, but to understand the why behind it. I am working on moving from brute-force approaches to optimized algorithms.
